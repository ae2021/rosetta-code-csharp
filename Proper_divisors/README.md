## Proper divisors
[rosettacode.org/wiki/Proper_divisors](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Proper_divisors)

The   proper divisors   of a positive integer N are those numbers, other than N itself, that divide N without remainder.

For N > 1 they will always include 1,   but for N == 1 there are no proper divisors.


Examples

> The proper divisors of     6     are   1, 2, and 3.
> The proper divisors of   100   are   1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, and 50.


Task

    

> Create a routine to generate all the proper divisors of a number.
> use it to show the proper divisors of the numbers 1 to 10 inclusive.
> Find a number in the range 1 to 20,000 with the most proper divisors. Show the number and just the count of how many proper divisors it has.
